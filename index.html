          <p>
            Surprisingly, I end up having to troubleshoot a lot of code in

          <h3>Perfectionist Designer</h3>
          <p>
            I always have a plan for how I want things to look, and put time

          <h3>Creator's mindset</h3>
          <p>
            I find that as I go forward into projects, I see exactly how things
            can be presented in a creative way, even if I'm not sure how to
            proceed yet

          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>
            As I trudged my way through my early life, I always found myself
            surrounded by technology. Eventually, as I reached my crossroads for
            school, I decided to take my HS education at the Phoenix Coding
            Academy as a programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunatly, COVID hit in my junior year, and I lost my motivation
            to continue programming, especially as virtual learning wasn't yet
            figured out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I lacked a job, knowledge on how to upgrade my tech, and even the
            knowledge on where to begin. I felt trapped. As much as I wanted to
            program again, I kept telling myself that I'd lost all the coding
            knowledge I'd gained.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took a while, but I've crawled my way out of my quarantine slump
            and I'm ready to dive right back in, starting with getting an
            college education with YearUp.
